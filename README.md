##Mastermind
The goal of this game is to guess a four color code that the computer has randomly generated.


If the guess is incorrect the computer provides feedback telling the user the number of correct inputs and the number of correct positions of said inputs.


Once the user guesses the code, he is provided with another set of feedback telling him the time it took to guess the code, what the code was, and how many attempts he had.


This project uses a REPL that works with the CLI.
